# Nutrition Issues In Georgia
This is a repository containing subsets on Georgia adult obesity and Georgia food environment index by county along with visual maps for each of the subsets. It also gives instructional material on how to create these subsets.

The repository also contains two python notebooks that are begginer modules:
1. Module on getting started using the pandas package
2. Module on using the pandas package for data analysis.

This data came from the County Health dataset.

This data is for doctors in Georgia who are interested in discovering the problem of adult obesity in certain places in Georgia, and the lack of nutrition people are getting from there food in certain places in Georgia.

This repository was created so doctors could figure out why people in Georgia have bad nutrition and suffer from obesity. People might use it to help improve the nutrition of people in Georgia.

# Visualizations
This choropleth map shows the levels of adult obesity recorded in each county in the state of Georgia. The lighter the shade means the lower the obesity level is, and the darker the shade means the higher the obesity level.

This choropleth map shows the levels of food environment index recorded in each county in the state of Georgia. The lighter the shade means the lower the food environment index is, and the darker the shade means the higher the food environment index is.

When you compare these two maps you notice a correlation between food environment index and obesity levels. If you look at the shading for the most part if obesity levels go up food environment index goes down and vice versa. This is because food environment index is calculated from poverty levels and easy access to nutritious food. Therefore, if the food environment index is low that means people probably don't have easy access to things like grocery stores, so they make unhealthy food choices and obesity levels go up.
